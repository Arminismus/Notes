The Exploration-Exploitation trade-off arises in a learning environment when our model of the world and [[Value Iteration|values of actions]] in them might not fully correspond to the true model. This is because our information of the world in incomplete and based on sampled feedback.


Hence, there is a need for us to test and challenge the assumptions of the model for the possibility of finding a better set of assumptions, and hence a better model.
