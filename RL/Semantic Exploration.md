Given the need for exploration as per the [[Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off]], we are interested in more systematic and meaningful ways of exploration that are not just random chance like the [[epsilon greedy]] exploration method.



1. Create a linguistic understanding of the environment and save and log it in a [[Vector Data Base|vector database]].
2. Use this understanding of the environment to devise exploration strategies.


Challenges:
1. [[Linguistic Understanding State Space|How can we create a linguistic understanding of an envrionment?]] 
2. [[Linguistic Planning|How can we use this in exploration, analoguous to how we humans do it?]]
