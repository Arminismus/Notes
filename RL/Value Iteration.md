Value iteration is an algorithm where one uses the [[Bellman Equation]] to update the **state-value** of each and every state. 

Then, when in that state, we use the [[Bellman Optimality Equation]], which chooses the action that gives the highest reward in the update for the value, which are the values that the optimal policy.
